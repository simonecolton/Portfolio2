# Portfolio2

Deployed Web Page at https://simonecolton.github.io/Portfolio2/

I unfortunately really struggled with updating my portfolio, I feel as though it is an improvement from the previous version I submitted, however still not quite what I wanted.

I chose to use Materialize CSS as found that the easiest to work with, however if I had my time over I would likely start my base CSS file again, as I made previous style choices which I found difficult to remove without rewriting the whole lot again.

I would also like to be able to have the links on the page go directly to the link they are referring to, rather than having to copy and paste the link into another browser window.
